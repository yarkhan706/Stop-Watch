# Stop Watch Web App

This is a simple web app that functions as a stop watch. You can start, pause, and reset the timer.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. The web page will display a container with the current time shown in the format "HH:mm:ss".
3. Click the "START" button to begin the timer. The timer will count up from the initial time of "00:00:00".
4. Click the "PAUSE" button to pause the timer at its current time. Clicking "START" again will resume the timer from where it left off.
5. Click the "RESET" button to reset the timer back to "00:00:00".
6. The app provides accurate timekeeping, updating every 75 milliseconds.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the stopwatch layout and elements.
- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the stopwatch container and buttons.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file with the logic to control the stopwatch.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the stopwatch and buttons by modifying the CSS styles in the `style.css` file. Additionally, you can modify the JavaScript logic in the `index.js` file to adjust the stopwatch's behavior.
